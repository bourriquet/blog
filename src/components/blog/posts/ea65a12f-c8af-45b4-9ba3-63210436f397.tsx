        <em>Transferred from my old Year Abroad blog.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The year abroad has begun! I arrived in Utrecht two days ago without any
        major problems.
      </p>

      <p>
        I flew from Manchester to Amsterdam with KLM. On checking in, I was
        offered to check in my hand luggage for free, which I opted for, but my
        case arrived in Amsterdam with a broken handle. Not only that, but my
        other suitcase was going around the carousel slightly open with a shirt
        sleeve hanging out! Luckily, I think everything stayed in. A pretty
        quick and non-eventful flight; this was the first time I’d ever flown
        alone and I was feeling <em>very</em> adult.
      </p>

        Amsterdam Schiphol airport is <em>huge</em>. I was very thankful that
        ESN (Erasmus Student Network) had organised a welcome meet at the
        airport to help us buy train tickets and usher us onto the 20 minute
        train to Utrecht. The intercity trains here are double-deckered and very
        clean with free Wifi (I’m used to Northern Rail’s converted bus Pacer
        trains and London Underground).
      </p>

      <p>
        On arrival in Utrecht, we were shepherded onto buses to De Uithof campus
        (where my lectures will be) by ESN to pick up our accommodation keys.
        The bus was not only a slinky bus, but a double-slinky bus (three
        compartments!), which blew my used-to-London-red-bus mind. Keys in hand,
        it was a long wait for the free minibus to Van Lieflandlaan, my home for
        the next ten months. I’d bumped into my neighbour by chance at Schiphol,
        so at least I wasn’t totally alone while waiting.
      </p>

      <p>
        As an international student, I had a choice of a few student halls
        offered by SSH Student Housing. I'd chosen Tuindorp-West Complex as it is
        off-campus - my first year halls were off-campus, and I
        quite liked not always being in the uni bubble. It is a bit of a commute
        to campus on public transport, but once I have a bike, it will be a
        15-20 minute cycle to campus and a 10 minute cycle to the city centre.
      </p>

      <p>
        In our flat, we have one English (me), one Welsh, four Spanish, one
        Austrian, two Romanian and one Australian, so quite a mix. My room is
        quite big (at least double the size of my room in my first year halls in
        London), with a very bright orange wall - a fitting welcome to Oranje!

        No time to rest after arriving, as it was straight into university
        induction the next day. After the faculty introduction on the first day,
        the EGEA (European Geography Association) branch in Utrecht had
        organised a fun afternoon of activities to welcome us. My team won the
        quiz and our prize was a pack of stroopwafels - my first taste of a
        stroopwafel and it did not disappoint! This was followed by a treasure
        hunt in Utrecht, dinner at an Italian restaurant along the Oudegracht
        canal and a pub crawl. The next day was a general exchange student
        induction, with a lecture about Dutch culture (summary: get a bike ASAP),
        and even more stroopwafels.

        My lectures start tomorrow, 11am - 5pm, so a pretty long day. I have
        every Tuesday and Thursday off, and I’m only in lectures for two hours
        on Mondays and Fridays, taking only two modules at a time. It'll be a nice
        change from three or six hours of lectures five days a week at Imperial!
        There seems to be a lot of emphasis on self-study here, which will be
        something to get used to.

        Some random observations:

        <ul>
          <li>
            I’m on the tenth floor of a high-rise building and my window opens
            completely. This would never stand in the UK - my second-floor room in
            my first-year halls opened 1cm at most!
          </li>
          <li>
            Public transport runs on time.
          </li>
          <li>
            The apples here are <em>huge</em>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Squash does not seem to exist. I bought “Strawberry Dilutable Fruit
            Drink”, expecting squash... it was syrup. Would not recommend.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Everyone</em> cycles. It is probably safer to cycle than to walk
            (no joke). I haven’t seen a single person wear a helmet. I’ve also
            seen someone cycle while holding a keyboard and someone cycle in
            high heels.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        My plans for the next few days include my first lectures, activating my
        bank account, finding an IKEA (my room desperately needs sprucing up!)
        and a trip to the dunes this weekend with EGEA. No idea where these
        dunes are, but welcome parties have been promised. I’m also going to
        open my <em>Learn Dutch in 3 Months</em> book, as I feel ignorant not
        knowing a single word.
