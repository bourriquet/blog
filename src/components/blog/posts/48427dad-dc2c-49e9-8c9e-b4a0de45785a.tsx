        Months of <Link to="/post/72db75a3-a0cf-4fd5-b46e-041642ec6da9" target="_blank">preparation for LEJOG</Link> and
        the it was finally time to head off to Lands End to begin the
        1,000 mile journey across the length of the UK.
      </p>

      <h3>Streatham to Paddington</h3>
      <p>
        We'd decided to get the train to Penzance then cycle to Lands End, where
        we’d be spending the night before starting LEJOG the next day. The
        first test was the cycle to Paddington station with bikes loaded up
        with all of our things for the next 16 days. Of course, it was pouring
        down with rain for the first cycle of the trip, but the first hurdle for
        me was actually getting on my bike. The weight and width of the loaded
        panniers made things a little unstable, and my bike nearly ended up flat
        on the floor while I was trying to get on it. Lack of training showing
        already, but after a second attempt, I was safely on.
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s a fairly straight-forward cycle to Paddington from Streatham, though
        this was my first cycle with a fully-laden bike. One wrong turn and just
        under an hour later, we were safely at Paddington, with plenty of time
        to stock up on snacks (the carb-loading starts here!) before the 5 hour
        journey to Penzance.
      </p>

      </p>

      <h3>End of the line</h3>
      <p>
        Boarding started late and the train was fully booked, so it felt a
        little hectic trying to unload the bikes and get them racked on the train
        in time.

      </p>

      <p>
        Just over three hours later, we were crossing the River Tamar into
        Cornwall, over Brunel's famous Royal Albert Bridge. Strange to think
        that in less than 48 hours, we'd be crossing the river in the other
        direction, but by ferry rather than train. Once we were in Cornwall, the
        train started to thin out and we were soon in Penzance, the end of the line!

      <h3>Penzance</h3>
      <p>
        This my first time in Penzance, but we were keen to get to Lands End to
        set up camp, so we weren't sticking around for too long. Just outside the
        station, a sign welcomes you to Penzance in the Cornish language.

      <p>
        We wanted to try out <a href="http://www.willywallers.co.uk/" target="_blank">Willy Wallers</a> ice
        cream, just a short walk from the train station. We saw a few groups cycle
        past with Prostate Cancer UK jerseys on heading towards Lands End for the
        end of their JOGLE. Now very close to the point of no return and faced
        with having to cycle on unfamiliar roads, my nerves had
        well and truly returned, but seeing people about to finish their
        End-to-End journey and having a great time doing so gave me a little bit
        of confidence. My sorbet from Willy Wallers was also a very welcome
        distraction!

      <h3>Penzance to Lands End</h3>
      <p>
        The Cicerone recommended route between Penzance and Lands End is the
        A30, which we would be taking the next day on our return to Penzance,
        but I’d planned an alternative, more scenic coastal route to the
        campsite while we had some time. All going well, I was hoping we
        could cycle down to a beach and spend a couple of hours there.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, I’d made one catastrophic mistake… I hadn’t checked the
        elevation profile. As soon as we left Penzance, it was straight into a
        14% incline. No easing into it or getting used to the added
        weight on the bike. It was a bit of a shock to the system, and I ended
        up walking most of this first incline, which sparked a few laughs from a
        passing postman - they must see this all of the time!
      </p>

      <p>
        The downhills weren’t much better for me. I wasn’t yet used to the speed the
        added weight gives you on a decline and I found myself hanging on for
        dear life. We were also on a 60mph country lane, a far cry from the
        gridlock London traffic I’m used to, but there was no choice but to
        persevere. At least the scenery was good - green Cornish
        countryside and the sea fast-approaching in the distance.
      </p>

        />
      </p>

      <p>
        I gave up on the beach idea very easily. There was no way I was subjecting
        myself to more hills than I needed to! It took much longer to to get to
        Lands End than anticipated, but one last corner and the campsite
        was finally in sight.

      <h3>Lands End</h3>
      <p>
        We were staying at the recently-opened <a href="https://www.landsendcamp.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lands End Camping & Glamping</a>,
        less than a mile away from the famous Lands End landmark. We very
        clearly looked like we were about to start LEJOG as the owners were
        laughing at our decision to bring an electric hook-up, and bet that we
        would end up ditching it within a few days. They even offered to buy it
        for £15, but I was absolutely determined to get some use out of it.

      </p>

      <p>
        Tent pitched up and electric hook-up untangled, we walked the
        short distance into Sennen to grab some food. There weren’t too many
        options for food in Sennen, but, being by the seaside, it had to be a
        chippy with some local Tribute ale.

        We walked down to the Lands End landmark to check things out. I'd read
        mostly bad things about Lands End, that it’s purely a tourist trap (true)
        and that there isn't much to see or do (also true). But, we’d really lucked
        out with a beautiful sunset, which only added to the stunning views
        from the most south-westernly tip of mainland England.

        It was the perfect time for photos with the famous signpost, as most of
        the crowds had died down and the peddlers charging £15 for a photo had
        already left for the day. We also saw someone who had just finished
        their JOGLE cycle!

        We walked along the coastline to stretch our legs, hoping to make it to
        Sennen Cove or at least catch a glimpse of the RMS Mulheim shipwreck.
        Unfortunately we didn't get as far as the shipwreck as it was getting
        dark quite quickly, but the walk along the coastline was a lovely end
        to a long day regardless.

        Back to the campsite for a timed 5 minute shower and an early
        night before hitting the Cornish hills the next day. I hadn’t seen such
        a clear sky in a very long time!
