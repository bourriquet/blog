        Months of <Link to="/post/72db75a3-a0cf-4fd5-b46e-041642ec6da9" target="_blank">preparation for LEJOG</Link> and the big day had finally arrived! We
        were off to Lands End to begin our 1,000 mile journey across the length
        of the UK.
      </p>

      <h3>Streatham to Paddington</h3>
      <p>
        We'd decided to get the train to Penzance then cycle to Lands End, where
        we’d be spending the night before the Grand Départ the next morning. Our
        first test was the cycle to Paddington station with our bikes loaded up
        with all of our things for the next 16 days. Of course, it was pouring
        down with rain for the first cycle of the trip, but the first hurdle for
        me was actually getting on my bike. The weight and width of the loaded
        panniers made things a little unstable, and my bike nearly ended up flat
        on the floor while I was trying to get on it. Second attempt and I was
        safely on.
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s a fairly straight-forward cycle to Paddington for us, though this
        was both of our first cycles with fully-laden bikes. We’re both quite
        used to cycling with the London traffic, Jonathan more so and much more
        confident with it than I am. A few km in and I was thinking that this
        actually wasn’t all that bad (my cycles often turn out like this…), and
        the nerves slowly started to turn into excitement for the days ahead.
      </p>

      <p>
        One wrong turn and just under an hour later, we were safely at
        Paddington, with plenty of time to stock up on snacks (the carb-loading
        starts here!) before the 5 hour journey to Penzance.
      </p>

      <h3>End of the line</h3>
      <p>
        Boarding started late and the train was fully booked, so it felt a
        little hectic trying to unload our bikes and get them racked in time.
        Our seats were at the other end of the train to our allocated bike spots
        so I held down the fort on the platform minding our bags while Jonathan
        ran back and forth with both of the bikes.

      <p>
        Just over three hours later, we were crossing the River Tamar into
        Cornwall, over Brunel's famous Royal Albert Bridge. Strange to think
        that in less than 48 hours, we'd be crossing the river in the other
        direction, but by ferry rather than train.

        />
      </p>

      <p>
        Once we were in Cornwall, the train started to thin out and we were
        soon in Penzance, the end of the line!

      <h3>Penzance</h3>
      <p>
        This was both of our first times in Penzance, but we weren’t sticking
        around for too long as we were keen to get to Lands End to set up camp.
        Just outside the station, a sign welcomes you to Penzance in the Cornish
        language.

      </p>

      <p>
        We wanted to try out <a href="http://www.willywallers.co.uk/" target="_blank">Willy Wallers</a> ice
        cream, just a short walk from the train station. We saw a few groups of
        cyclists cycle past with Prostate Cancer UK jerseys on heading towards
        Lands End for the end of their JOGLE. Now very close to the point of no
        return and faced with having to cycle on unfamiliar roads, my nerves had
        well and truly returned, but seeing people about to finish their
        End-to-End journey and having a great time doing so gave me a little bit
        of confidence. My sorbet from Willy Wallers was also a very welcome
        distraction!

      <h3>Penzance to Lands End</h3>
      <p>
        The Cicerone recommended route between Penzance and Lands End is the
        A30, which we would be taking the next day on our return to Penzance,
        but I’d planned an alternative, more scenic coastal route to take us to
        our campsite while we had the time. All going well, I was hoping we
        could cycle down to a beach and spend a couple of hours there.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, I’d made one catastrophic mistake… I hadn’t checked the
        elevation profile. As soon as we left Penzance, it was straight into a
        14% incline. No easing ourselves into it or getting used to the added
        weight on our bikes. It was a bit of a shock to the system, and I ended
        up walking most of this first incline, which sparked a few laughs from a
        passing postman - they must see this all of the time!
      </p>

      <p>
        The downhills weren’t much better. I wasn’t yet used to the speed the
        added weight gives you on a decline and I found myself hanging on for
        dear life. We were also on a 60mph country lane, a far cry from the
        gridlock London traffic I’m used to, so we had no choice but to
        persevere with the hills. At least the scenery was good - green Cornish
        countryside either side of us and the sea fast-approaching in the
        distance.
      </p>

        />
      </p>

      <p>
        We gave up on the beach trip pretty easily. We were already pretty high
        above sea level and there was no way we were subjecting ourselves to
        more hills than we needed to! We’d taken more time to get to Lands End
        than we thought we would, but we turned one last corner and our campsite
        was finally in sight.
      </p>

      <h3>Lands End</h3>
      <p>
        We were staying at the recently-opened <a href="https://www.landsendcamp.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lands End Camping & Glamping</a>,
        less than a mile away from the famous Lands End landmark. We very
        clearly looked like we were about to start LEJOG as the owners were
        laughing at our decision to bring an electric hook-up, and bet that we
        would end up ditching it within a few days. They even offered to buy it
        from us for £15, but we were determined to get some use out of it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tent pitched up, electric hook-up untangled and having worked up some
        appetite on the surprise hills on our cycle to Lands End, we walked the
        short distance into Sennen to grab some food. We walked past the
        first/last inn in England - can't wait to see the first/last inn in
        Scotland at the other end!
      </p>

      </p>

      <p>
        There weren’t too many options for food in Sennen, but, being by the
        seaside, it had to be a chippy. I think everyone else in Lands End had
        the same idea, as we had quite a long wait outside for our food. The
        perfect opportunity to pick up some local Tribute ale.
      </p>

      </p>

      <p>
        We walked down to the Lands End landmark to check things out. I'd read
        mostly bad things about Lands End, that it’s purely a tourist trap (true)
        and that there isn't much to see or do (also true). We’d really lucked
        out with the beautiful sunset, which only added to the stunning views
        from the most south-westernly tip of mainland England.

        It was the perfect time for photos with the famous signpost, as most of
        the crowds had died down and the peddlers charging £15 for a photo had
        already left for the day. We also saw someone who had just finished
        their JOGLE cycle!

        We walked along the coastline to stretch our legs, hoping to make it to
        Sennen Cove or at least catch a glimpse of the RMS Mulheim shipwreck.
        Unfortunately we didn't get as far as the shipwreck as it was getting
        dark quite quickly, but the walk along the coastline was a lovely end
        to a long day regardless.
