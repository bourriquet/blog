        My personalised ads are remarkably accurate at times, and Facebook
        really did not miss the mark with
        suggesting <a href="https://www.rebelbadgestore.com/" target="_blank">Rebel Badges</a> for
        me. The concept is very simple - 53 merit badges to work
        towards and collect, just like Scouts/Guides, but for adults.

        I was never really into Girlguiding as a child. I was a Brownie for only
        about a month (I’m sure my empty sash is somewhere in the attic), but
        I do remember reading the badge book cover to cover. For some reason,
        bell ringing is what first comes to mind when I think about that book,
        not that I was ever going to pursue that! Now that I’m all
        grown, I love setting myself personal challenges and
        trying new things. Having had a look through the Rebel Badges and the
        clauses to complete for them, I found that some of them were things
        that I already wanted to do one day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Case in point: this blog! I’ve been meaning to set this blog up since
        I got back from my Land’s End to John o’Groats cycle in August 2021,
        but things kept getting in the way; mostly my inability to decide
        what I wanted this blog to look like. The <em>Writer</em> badge has
        been the nudge I needed to get the blog set up - even if it isn't
        exactly how I'd like it to look just yet - and start revisiting my
        cycle trip, as well as transfer some posts from my old study abroad
        blog.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rebel Badges has a
        supportive and growing <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/579616703393446/" target="_blank">online community</a>.
        I've seen a few members categorise the badges, so I have decided to
        do the same, according to the likelihood of me completing the badge. I
        have a busy couple of months coming up, so I'm likely to not start
        in earnest until June.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm also going to try not to backdate any clauses, with the exception
        of my Land's End to John o'Groats cycle last year counting towards the
        challenge aspect of the <em>Explorer</em> badge. I just don't think
        I'll be able to top it, and have no intention of doing anything that
        physically demanding and life-consuming for some time.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is all about trying new things and challenging myself, so I'm
        going to try to complete as much as I can!
