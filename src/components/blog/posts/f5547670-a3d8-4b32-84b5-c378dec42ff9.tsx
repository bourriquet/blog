        There are only twelve days to go until I up sticks and move to the
        Netherlands for my Erasmus year
        at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.uu.nl/en">Universiteit Utrecht</a>.
        I don’t think I’ve ever switched between feeling excited and thinking
        “what have I gotten myself into” as much as I have over the last 48 hours,
        especially since waking up yesterday and realising that I’m leaving next
        week!

        For the uninitiated, the Erasmus programme is an EU student exchange
        programme, allowing exchanges of between three months and one year. I’ll
        be spending the third year of my degree abroad, studying Earth Science (my
        degree is actually in Geophysics, but this isn’t offered at UU), with the
        modules I take counting towards my degree just as they would at home. You
        are also eligible for a grant on the Erasmus programme to contribute towards
        the costs associated with moving and living abroad, and for Brits, you
        pay no tuition fees while you are abroad.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why Utrecht? I’ll be honest, while I’ve always wanted to study abroad
        since I knew it was a thing, I’d only ever really considered going to
        the US or Canada. When it came to choosing my year abroad options in my
        second year, I started looking into the options available to me in the
        US and Canada, and there was absolutely no way I could afford it. With
        no formal partnerships between my department and American/Canadian
        departments, I would be classed as a “visiting student” and would have
        to pay a substantial fee per course I took. Add to that the cost of
        flights, health insurance and accommodation, and there was no way I
        could make it work (I did the maths multiple times) and still be able to
        enjoy myself without having to work part-time, if that was even
        permitted on a student visa.
      </p>

        There were other options, though. I’d continued studying French as an
        extra-curricular at university, but while my everyday French was
        probably good enough to get by, I wasn’t confident that my French
        Geophysics vocabulary would be strong enough. I was finding the
        degree hard enough in English, let alone a language that I wasn’t fluent
        in! So, I resigned to not doing my third year abroad. I was disappointed,
        but consoled myself with knowing that there’d be other opportunities to
        study/work/live abroad in the future, perhaps when I had a little more
        disposable income.
      </p>

        One of my friends asked me if I’d considered studying at UU. I hadn’t -
        I’d assumed that I’d have to know Dutch, which I didn’t, but that turned
        out to not be the case! Part of the Erasmus programme, UU had a large
        number of exchange students, and most modules would be taught in
        English. Bonus, being part of Erasmus, I’d have no tuition fees and I’d
        be eligible for the Erasmus grant, taking away a good portion of my
        money worries for the year. I spoke to the person from my department
        currently on exchange at UU and I was sold. Utrecht looked beautiful and
        he’d had a fantastic year. The year abroad was back on!
      </p>
      <p>
        Apart from a little bit of paperwork to post to UU, there hasn’t been
        too much preparation to do before going away. Being a well-established
        and tested exchange programme, Erasmus happily takes away most of the
        hard work. The most crucial part was putting together the Learning
        Agreement, which is essentially the list of modules I’ll be studying in
        Utrecht.

        My main concern at the moment is that I don’t know a single word of
        Dutch. Most people I’ve spoken to about my plans for next year have
        replied with <em>“oh, so you can speak Dutch then?”</em>. Actually, no,
        not a word. Ashamedly, I don’t even know how to say <em>“thank
        you”</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I didn’t want to be that typical ignorant Brit abroad, so once
        everything was confirmed with my year abroad, I bought a book
        called <em>Speak Dutch in 3 Months</em>. I haven’t opened it. It’s in my
        wardrobe. The thought was there, but it’s too late now, and I’m hoping
        that my GCSE German and eight years worth of French will at least help
        me to pick up a little bit of Dutch.
      </p>

        Preparing for my big move is pretty much taking over my life right now,
        on top of finishing a summer placement
        at <a target="_blank" href="https://zxlidars.com">ZephIR Lidar</a> in
        the Malvern Hills, planning a joint 21st birthday/leaving party and
        finishing off summer project work for my degree. It’s not lost on me
        that I moved from the hustle and bustle of London to the sleepy (at
        least in comparison) town of Malvern at the start of summer, and will
        now be trading the Malvern Hills for one of the flattest countries
        around.
