        Two sentences I never thought I’d say: <em>“I’m going to cycle 1,000
        miles across the country”</em> and <em>“I’m going to spend 15
        consecutive nights in a tent”</em>. I’m very much a fair-weather cyclist
        and I've only ever camped at music festivals, but here I am, about to
        set off on a cycle trip from Land’s End to John o’Groats, camping along
        the way!
      </p>

      <p>
        Cycling either LEJOG (Land’s End to John o’Groats) or JOGLE (John
        o’Groats to Land’s End) has never been anywhere close to my bucket list.
        However, with the uncertainty around coronavirus quarantine rules and
        entry requirements, my partner Jonathan and I had resigned to not
        travelling abroad for a holiday this year. While looking for things we
        could do in the UK, the idea of a LEJOG or JOGLE cycle came to mind and
        the more I researched it, the more I wanted to give it a go myself. If
        not now, then when?
      </p>

      <p>
        A lot of preparation has gone into this trip, much more than I had
        initially anticipated. We had equipment to buy, both cycling and
        camping, as well as campsites to find, and, most importantly, a mammoth
        route to plan. Reading LEJOG/JOGLE blogs has been invaluable to me, so
        I’m hoping that this post about some of the things we've had to prepare
        before setting off will be of use to future end-to-enders.
      </p>

      <h3>Going It Alone</h3>
      <p>
        This was one of the first decisions we made, and it was quite an easy
        one for us . There is no shortage of companies offering LEJOG/JOGLE
        packages - both "supported" (you cycle as a group, stay in B&Bs
        together, have a support van that carries your things between stops) and
        "independent" (the company books your accommodation for you and plans
        your route, but you cycle by yourself).
      </p>

      <p>
        This was going to be our summer holiday, so we wanted to take our time,
        stop whenever we wanted to and see some sights. Cycling as part of an
        organised group would have perhaps taken some of that freedom away from
        us. There was also something about planning the entire thing ourselves
        and carrying everything with us that added to the fun!
      </p>

      <h3>The Route</h3>
      <p>
        I wasn't too keen on cycling on A-roads the whole way, so the fastest route was off
        the table. The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sustrans.org.uk/national-cycle-network/lands-end-to-john-ogroats-lejog">Sustrans route</a> was
        a good candidate as it is entirely on traffic-free paths and quiet roads
        - perfect for me! However, I was planning on taking my road bike, which
        wouldn't have coped well on some of the off-road paths, and I wasn't up
        for buying a new bike just for this trip.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cicerone.co.uk/why-cicerone-lejog-cycling-route-optimal-choice">Cicerone route</a> claims
        to be the "optimal" route - quiet roads where possible, busier roads
        where necessary. The route has been tried and tested on multiple bike
        types and adapted over the last twelve years. The recommended time for
        this route is two weeks, which was perfect for us given our other summer
        plans and needing to get back to work. The only downside to this route
        is that the quieter traffic-free roads tend to come at a cost... hills.
      </p>

        We plan to follow the Cicerone route as closely as we can, though will
        be adapting some of the recommended overnight stops along the way. We
        want to spend more time in Cornwall and Scotland - Cornwall to warm up
        the legs; Scotland to be tourists as neither of us have visited for a
        few years. I was born in the North West, so I'm quite happy to speed
        through here to make up lost time... and it will also be the flattest
        part of the route! We also have no rest days planned, aiming for ~80
        miles/day.
      </p>

      <h3>LEJOG or JOGLE?</h3>
      <p>
        LEJOG is generally the preferred route among end-to-enders. As you’re
        cycling in a mostly northerly direction, the sun is behind you and out
        of your eyes, and the rumour is that the prevailing south-westerly wind
        helps you along the way. The cycling is also toughest in
        Cornwall, with steep inclines and declines... something I definitely
        wanted to tackle at the start of the trip before the exhaustion had set
        in! Though there is the argument that by doing JOGLE, the Cornish hills
        should be easier as your cycling fitness will have improved having
        already climbed plenty of hills before reaching Cornwall.
      </p>

      <p>
        Living in London, it would be fairly straight-forward to get to and from
        either end. Between London and Land’s End, the journey is
        quite simple - a 5 hour train from Paddington to Penzance (there is also
        the option of a sleeper train), then a 15 mile cycle to Land’s End.
        Between London and John o’Groats, it’s a bit more complicated. Thurso
        and Wick are both ~20 miles from John o’Groats, from where you can catch
        one of a handful of trains per day to Inverness. Between Inverness and
        London, it’s a 9+ hour train with changes or you can catch a direct 11
        hour sleeper train, the Caledonian Sleeper. Flying to/from Inverness was
        also an option, but we would then have to sort out
        transporting/renting/buying a bike box, adding extra cost and hassle.
        Travelling by train felt like the most sensible option.
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s free to take a bike onto a train in the UK, though reservations are
        usually compulsory. These get snapped up pretty quickly for
        long-distance journeys, especially on the Caledonian Sleeper. We knew we
        wanted to go in July or August (better weather, more sunlight) and had a
        preference for LEJOG, though it was the availability of bike spots on
        the Caledonian Sleeper that eventually determined our dates and
        direction. There were two bike spots available on a Tuesday night from
        Inverness to London in August - LEJOG it was!
      </p>

      <h3>Sleeping</h3>
      <p>
        Of course, we weren't the only ones looking to stay in the UK for a
        summer holiday given the year of the staycation. Cycle-friendly
        hotel/B&B availability was looking sparse, and much more expensive than
        we were prepared to pay for this trip. We figured camping would give us
        more flexibility and save us some money, and would also add to the
        adventure. The real adventure would have been to wild camp the entire
        way, but we wanted to keep the camping equipment we needed to carry to a
        minimum. I also didn't want to be washing in lakes for two weeks!
      </p>

      <p>
        Finding campsites with availability in August was difficult, and many
        had 2-night minimum bookings. After a lot of enquiring and shuffling
        around of our planned stops, we eventually found campsites with
        availability for most nights relatively close to the
        Cicerone route. The exception was the Bristol area, for which we booked
        an Airbnb. This feels like cheating a little bit, but I don't think
        we'll be complaining when we're in a warm bed!

      <h3>Sight-seeing</h3>
      <p>
        It's a holiday! We want to see things. A few weeks ago, I was pinged by
        the NHS app to self-isolate as I had been in contact with someone who
        had tested positive for Covid-19. I luckily didn't catch Covid-19
        myself, but I used the time to pore through the numerous travel books
        I'd already checked out from the library and put together a list of
        things we could see along the way. Easier said than done, as we will be
        lumbered with two bikes and all of our things, but we might be able to
        tick some of them off.
