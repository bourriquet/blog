        Two sentences I never thought I’d say: <em>“I’m going to cycle 1,000
        miles across the country”</em> and <em>“I’m going to spend 15
        consecutive nights in a tent”</em>. I’m very much a fair-weather cyclist
        and I've only ever camped at music festivals, but here I am, about to
        set off on a cycle trip from Land’s End to John o’Groats, camping along
        the way.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cycling either LEJOG (Land’s End to John o’Groats) or JOGLE (John
        o’Groats to Land’s End) has never been anywhere close to my bucket list.
        My partner, Jonathan, and I had ruled out travelling abroad this summer
        thanks to the uncertainty around Covid-19, so we looked for things we
        could do in the UK. The idea of a LEJOG or JOGLE cycle came to mind and
        the more I researched it, the more I wanted to give it a go myself. If
        not now, then when?
      </p>

      <p>
        Preparing for this trip has basically taken over my life. We had a lot
        of equipment to buy, both cycling and camping, as well as campsites to
        find, and, most importantly, a 1,000 mile route to plan. Reading others'
        LEJOG/JOGLE blogs has been invaluable to me, so I’m hoping that this
        post about some of the things we've had to prepare will be of use to
        those planning a similar trip, and maybe of interest to others.
      </p>

      <h3>Going It Alone</h3>
      <p>
        This was one of the first decisions we made, and it was quite an easy
        one for us. There is no shortage of companies offering LEJOG/JOGLE
        packages - both "supported" (you cycle as a group, stay in B&Bs
        together, have a support van that carries your things between stops) and
        "independent" (the company books your accommodation for you and plans
        your route, but you cycle by yourself).
      </p>

      <p>
        This is going to be our summer holiday, so we wanted to take our time,
        stop whenever we wanted to and see some sights. Cycling as part of an
        organised group would have perhaps taken some of that freedom away from
        us. There was also something about planning the entire thing ourselves
        and carrying everything with us that added to the fun!
      </p>

      <h3>The Route</h3>
      <p>
        I wasn't too keen on cycling on A-roads the whole way, so the fastest
        route was immediately off the table. The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sustrans.org.uk/national-cycle-network/lands-end-to-john-ogroats-lejog">Sustrans route</a> was
        a good candidate as it is entirely traffic-free paths and quiet roads
        - perfect for me! However, I'm planning on taking my road bike, which
        won't cope well on some of the off-road paths, and I wasn't up
        for buying a new bike just for this trip.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cicerone.co.uk/why-cicerone-lejog-cycling-route-optimal-choice">Cicerone route</a> claims
        to be the "optimal" route - quiet roads where possible, busier roads
        where necessary. The route has been tried and tested on multiple bike
        types and adapted over the last twelve years. The recommended time for
        this route is two weeks, which was perfect for us given our other summer
        plans and needing to get back to work. The only downside to this route
        (for us, or maybe just me) is that the quieter traffic-free roads tend
        to come at a cost... hills.
      </p>

      <p>
        My local library had a copy of the accompanying book available, which
        came with GPX files to download. These came in really handy for planning
        the more specific parts of our route such as where we were going to stop
        at night.
      </p>

      <p>

        />
      </p>

      <p>
        We plan to follow the Cicerone route as closely as we can, though will
        be adapting some of the recommended overnight stops along the way as we
        want to spend more time in Cornwall and Scotland. Due to where our
        families live, it is quite straight-forward for us to visit the North
        West, the Midlands and the Bristol area, so we are happy to power
        through these parts of the route to spend more time in the parts of the
        country which we visit less frequently. We also have no rest days
        planned, aiming for ~80 miles/day.
      </p>

      <h3>LEJOG or JOGLE?</h3>
      <p>
        LEJOG is generally the preferred route among end-to-enders. As you’re
        cycling in a mostly northerly direction, the sun is behind you and out
        of your eyes, and the rumour is that the prevailing south-westerly wind
        helps you along the way. The cycling is also toughest in
        Cornwall, with steep inclines and declines... something I
        wanted to tackle at the start of the trip before the exhaustion had set
        in! Though there is the argument that by doing JOGLE, the Cornish hills
        should be easier as your cycling fitness will have improved having
        already climbed plenty of hills before reaching Cornwall.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ultimately, our decision came down to the transport options available to us.
        Living in London, it was pretty much a no-brainer for us to take the
        train to the end-points, rather than fly or rent cars. The train can get
        you 15 miles from Land's End and ~20 miles from John o'Groats, so not
        too far to cycle at either end. Flying would have meant sorting out bike
        boxes at either end, plus transportation to/from Exeter and Inverness airports.
        Driving would have just been a horrible nightmare, not even worth considering.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is free to take a bike onto a train in the UK, though reservations
        are usually compulsory. These can get snapped up pretty quickly for
        long-distance journeys, especially the Caledonian Sleeper, which we were
        keen on taking, as the daytime London-Inverness journey includes
        changes. There were two bike spots available on a Tuesday night from
        Inverness to London in August - LEJOG it was!
      </p>

      <h3>Sleeping</h3>
      <p>
        Of course, we weren't the only ones booking accommodation in the UK
        given the year of the staycation. Cycle-friendly hotel/B&B availability
        was looking sparse, and more expensive than we were prepared to pay for
        this trip. We figured camping would give us more flexibility, save us
        some money and also add to the adventure. The real adventure would
        have been to wild camp the entire way, but we wanted to keep the camping
        equipment we needed to carry to a minimum. I also didn't want to be
        washing in lakes for two weeks!
      </p>

      <p>
        Finding campsites with availability in August was difficult, and many
        had 2-night minimum bookings (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.campsites.co.uk/search">campsites.co.uk</a> is
        a really helpful website for finding campsites). After a lot of
        enquiring and shuffling around of our planned stops, we eventually found
        campsites relatively close to the Cicerone route with availability for
        most nights of the trip. The exception was the Bristol area, for which we have
        had to book an Airbnb as we haven't been able to find a campsite with
        availability. This feels like cheating a little bit, but I don't think
        we'll be complaining once we're there.
      </p>

      <h3>The Noble Steeds</h3>
      <p>
        Hybrid/touring bikes are recommended for unsupported long-distance
        cycles, but I had already resigned to taking my road bike for this trip.
        I was lucky enough to get a ballot spot for the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ridelondon.co.uk/">RideLondon 100</a> last
        year, and bought a road bike especially for it (my other bike is a
        Dutch-style city bike, which I love for short local cycles but it's not
        suitable for RideLondon 100 or LEJOG). RideLondon 100 was unfortunately
        cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and while I've cycled my road
        bike around London and up Box Hill, it would be nice to get some more
        mileage out of it.
      </p>

      <p>
        My road bike isn't a particularly flashy model and was relatively cheap,
        but it's light enough and I feel comfortable riding it, though I'm
        anticipating a bit of a bumpy ride if we do need to go off-road!
        One downside is that my frame doesn't have many eyelets for attaching
        accessories, but there are workarounds.
      </p>

      <p>
        <PostImageSingle

        />
      </p>

      <p>
        I sent my bike off for a full service with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.havebike.co.uk/">HaveBike</a> a
        couple of weeks ago. I was fairly confident my bike wouldn't need any major
        repairs, so I did leave it a little bit later than I probably should
        have for a pre-trip service. Luckily I was right, and I only needed a
        pedal disc replacement. Jonathan had less luck with his bike. He also
        used HaveBike to service his (hybrid) bike, but, unlike me, did give it
        plenty of time as his bike has had a lot more use than mine.
        Unfortunately, he needed a pretty major repair, and HaveBike were having
        supply chain issues with sourcing the needed part in time. Even if the
        bike was returned without the repair, he wouldn't have been able to
        cycle it, so he had to buy a new bike (another hybrid) with quite short
        notice.
      </p>

      <h3>Bike Equipment</h3>
      <p>
        This would be our first touring trip, so we had a fair bit of equipment
        to buy. By far the most important things were panniers and rear racks.
      </p>

      <p>
        For panniers, I went for the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/540-waterproof-double-pannier-rack-bike-bags-2-x-20l/_/R-p-193373?mc=8403056&c=BLACK">ELOPS 2x20L double pannier</a>.
        I preferred the double panniers as they will be easier to get on and
        off trains and carry around if we do stop anywhere. They're rainproof
        but not immersion-proof, but I figured if they are being immersed, then
        something has gone drastically wrong! All of the contents will be in dry
        bags anyway, so having completely waterproof panniers isn't a priority
        for me. Jonathan went for two <a target="_blank" href="https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/mp/altura/thunderstorm-adventure-pannier-adventure-red-25l-waterproof-hi-viz/_/R-p-822c3523-1afc-4b39-8a76-39987c718501?mc=822c3523-1afc-4b39-8a76-39987c718501_c14">fancier 25L panniers</a>,
        likely to be much more waterproof with the roll-tops.
      </p>

      <p>
        We looked into frame bags, but took our time buying them as there were
        a lot of options and we weren't too sure how many we needed. Jonathan's
        friend lent us a couple of waterproof frame bags in the end; a big one
        which we will be using as a tool bag and a smaller one which we'll be
        using as an essentials grab bag (money, phones, face mask) for when we
        go into shops for example. I’ll also be taking a high-vis mini rucksack
        for easy-grab snacks (very important).
      </p>

      <p>
        For rear racks, we both went for the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.halfords.com/cycling/bike-accessories/bike-pannier-racks/tortec-transalp-rear-disc-rack-26-700c---black-583858.html?cm_mmc=Google+PLA-_-Cycling%3EBike+Accessories%3EPannier+Racks-_-Cycling%3EBike+Accessories%3EPannier+Racks-_-583858&istCompanyId=b8708c57-7a02-4cf6-b2c0-dc36b54a327e&istFeedId=62b447cf-331e-4fec-a47a-9985ff72d404&istItemId=xqqxrxwq&istBid=tzwp&_$ja=tsid:|cid:17326032867|agid:|tid:|crid:|nw:x|rnd:5851281770910016610|dvc:c|adp:|mt:|loc:9045909&gclid=CjwKCAjwtIaVBhBkEiwAsr7-c9cJ7_xd4I58Ra2ksuSMZ9wKhylKGOaSs9wKocJ7zJnDuE0pPhxD4xoCjqMQAvD_BwE">Tortec Transalp rear disc rack</a>.
        Jonathan attached his to his bike fairly easily as he has eyelets, but
        mine took a bit longer. One workaround we'd found to attach a rear rack
        to a bike without eyelets is to use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/mp/tortec/p-clips/_/R-p-c2fa9fd8-3d6b-4581-b01b-793af30e140e?mc=c2fa9fd8-3d6b-4581-b01b-793af30e140e_c1&utm_term=429db383-d321-47b5-b806-c7b91d332ebc&gclid=CjwKCAjwtIaVBhBkEiwAsr7-cwSTu2PntaoQU1Ehl5Gj5Kw4bHvvEFjCxVAPd0o0PI1qUQXv2__4dRoCr0wQAvD_BwE&iv_=__iv_p_1_g_135919246024_c_557229211113_w_aud-1032351663542%253Apla-329717981662_n_g_d_c_v__l__t__r_x_pla_y_15177021_f_online_o_429db383-d321-47b5-b806-c7b91d332ebc_z_GB_i_en_j_329717981662_s__e__h_9045909_ii__vi__&gclsrc=aw.ds">P-clips</a> (essentially
        mini clamps). Four P-clips later and my rear rack was attached to my
        bike, and it felt much more secure than I was expecting. I've done a
        couple of test rides with weights in my panniers and the P-clips haven't
        slipped at all. We'll be taking some spares with us though as I doubt
        that will be the case over 1,000 miles.
      </p>

      <p>
        We had less luck attaching mudguards to my bike. While I did have
        eyelets near my wheels, there just wasn’t enough clearance between the
        tyre and the frame to attach the guards. I was so desperate to get them
        to fit, that we even tried sawing down the attachment, but there was no
        way. I’m just going to have to cope with a muddy back!
      </p>

          portrait
        />
      </p>

      <p>
        We've decided to forego a GPS bike computer... we will
        probably regret this decision. We're both taking our phones (and
        battery packs), so we should be okay for navigation if we get lost.
        We've also got print-outs of our intended route, handily split up by
        day, as a back-up.
      </p>

      <p>
        Clothing-wise, I desperately needed some padded cycling shorts. My bike
        seat isn't the most comfortable, and I will be on my bike <i>a lot</i> over
        the next two weeks, so I definitely need some support. I also picked up
        a new high-vis jacket as my current one isn't very breathable. The new
        one is only splashproof but it's at least very light for cycling. I hate
        cycling in sunglasses, but over 1,000 miles, I knew that I would end
        up needing to use them at some point. I found a pair and even though I
        haven't worn them yet, I've somehow managed to scratch the lens! We’ve
        both decided not to bother with cleats or waterproof shoes, another
        decision we’ll probably regret.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another essential for me is cycling gloves. My hands are quite small and
        they cramp up on my handles over long distances, especially in the rain.
        Gloves take off a little bit of that pressure while trying to maintain
        my grip. I already had some (very cheap) cycling gloves in a very
        beautiful fluorescent orange, but I will be taking some weight training
        gloves as a back up.
      </p>

      <p>
        The absolute minimum essentials - decent helmets and lights - we both of
        course already had, and we also picked up a few bungee cords from
        the bargain bin at Go Outdoors, as well as a handful of inner tubes.
      </p>

      <h3>Camping Equipment</h3>
      <p>
        I've always written off camping as being <em>not for me</em>. I'm a
        fairly light sleeper and I find the whole experience cramped and very
        uncomfortable. Saying that, I've only ever camped in cheap and
        definitely not waterproof festival tents. I've been promised many a
        time that <em>actual</em> camping is much more enjoyable, so I'm going
        into this with an open mind.
      </p>

      <p>
        Buying a legitimate, actually waterproof yet portable tent was something
        we didn't take lightly. A good hour was spent testing out the many options
        in Go Outdoors, eventually deciding on a 3-person Coleman tent with a
        little porch area, good waterproof rating and 10-minute assembly time.
        Certainly an improvement on my previous £8 1-man tents! We took the tent
        to <a href="https://www.valleyfest.co.uk/" target="_blank">Valleyfest</a> to
        test it out for the night. My first night in a proper tent and I actually
        had a good night’s sleep! Perhaps camping is for me after all.
      </p>

      <p>
        <PostImageSingle

          portrait
        />
      </p>

      <p>
        The next challenge was trying to figure out what we could take with us
        while keeping weight and volume to a minimum. We both went for light
        Berghaus summer sleeping bags, Jonathan a self-inflating sleeping mat,
        and me a blow-up sleeping mat with attached pillow. No cooking equipment
        - we just didn’t have the room, and I feel like we’ll be wanting more
        substantial meals after burning 4,000+ calories a day.
      </p>

      <p>
        As we’ll be relying on our phones a lot throughout the trip for
        navigating, taking photos and recording on Strava, we needed an electric
        hook-up. It’ll add on significant weight/bulk to our bikes, but we
        figured it’d be worth it for guaranteed electricity. I don’t think we’ll
        have enough time to sit in pubs or cafes waiting for phones to charge.
      </p>

      <h3>Training</h3>
      <p>
        I had grand hopes of putting in some serious mileage in training for
        this trip… cycling the London Loop, cycling to Brighton, maybe even a
        weekend cycling around the Isle of Wight, throwing in some much-needed
        hill training along the way. None of this happened, nor has any real
        long-distance training at that. Luckily, I do work out a lot as it is,
        so I’ve made myself feel better by convincing myself that it’s all
        cross-training. Even so, the closer the trip has become, the more I’ve
        panicked about my lack of training, especially when it comes to hills.
      </p>

      <p>
        I knew I needed to get some practice with handling the weight and width
        the panniers will add to my bike. So I set off on a cycle a few days ago
        with some dumbbells in my panniers to add some weight. And it was
        raining! Another box ticked.
      </p>

          portrait
        />
      </p>

      <p>
        While I was cycling down a contraflow cycle
        lane, I noticed a smashed glass bottle, but it was too late to do
        anything about it without swerving into oncoming traffic, so I had to
        cycle through it. I thought I’d managed to get away with it, but about
        half an hour later, my back tyre was completely flat. 7 miles from home,
        no spare inner tubes and too late for any bike workshops to still be
        open. I had no choice but to start walking home with the bike (terrible
        for the wheel of course), until Jonathan was back from swimming and
        could pick me and my out-of-action bike up.
      </p>

      <p>
        Taking a closer look at home, the damage was <em>bad</em>. A piece of
        glass had left a large hole in the sidewall of my tyre. I looked into my
        repair options, but with sidewall punctures, it is best to just
        completely replace the tyre. You can “boot patch” a hole in a tyre, but
        these only last for about 200km, and we have over 1,600km to cycle! Even
        if I replaced the boot patch every 200km, the risk of tyre blowouts is
        still quite high, and not worth the risk. I’m gutted because I love the
        yellow-rim road tyres on my bike and they’re now discontinued, but I
        know I do need something more practical and less puncture-prone for this
        trip.

        Luckily, I managed to get a new tyre delivered yesterday (bit of a panic
        as I wasn’t due to be at home), and I got out on a longer drama-free
        test cycle earlier today.

      <h3>Sightseeing</h3>
      <p>
        It's a holiday! We want to see things. A few weeks ago, I was pinged by
        the NHS app to self-isolate for a week as I had been in contact with
        someone who had tested positive for Covid-19. I luckily didn't contract
        Covid-19 myself, but I used the time to pore through the numerous travel
        books I'd already checked out from the library and put together a list of
        things we could see along the way. Easier said than done, as we will be
        lumbered with two bikes and all of our things, but we might be able to
        tick some of them off.

        I'll be posting after the trip to see how many of these we do manage
        to tick off!
