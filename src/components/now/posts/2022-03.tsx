        ✈️ I spent a week in beautiful Cape Verde at the start of the month and
        worked from “home” for a few days of my trip - I’m very lucky to work
        for a company that allows working from anywhere!

        📺 I’m trying to watch all 60 Disney classics in chronological order
        before my Walt Disney World trip. Next up is <em>The Rescuers</em> with
        38 films still to go. I've also been catching up with <em>This Is
        Us</em>.

        🎭 I recently saw Andrew Lloyd Webber’s <em>Cinderella</em> on the West
        End which I really enjoyed.

        🧶 Crafting has been on the back-burner recently but I did do some work
        on my crochet husky while I was isolating with Christmas Omicron, and
        have made a few cards with my Cricut machine.

        🏃🏼‍♀️ Loving being back at mass participation events! I've been on a PB
        streak recently and managed a sub-50 minute 10k and a sub-2 hour half
        marathon this month.

        🏋🏼 Trying to go
        to <em><a href="https://www.lesmills.com/uk/workouts/group-fitness/bodypump/" target="_blank">BodyPump</a></em> at
        least four times a week. My gym no longer
        offers <em><a href="https://www.lesmills.com/uk/workouts/group-fitness/bodyattack/" target="_blank">BodyAttack</a></em> and
        I miss it so much.

        🍽️ Enjoyed another veganuary! This time I tried to eat more vegetables
        and fewer processed meat substitutes but Birds Eye made it very
        difficult with their vegan chicken strips.
