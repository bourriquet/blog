We\n        were off to Lands End to begin our 1,000 mile journey across the length\n        of the UK.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>Streatham to Paddington</h3>\n      <p>\n        We'd decided to get the train to Penzance then cycle to Lands End, where\n        we’d be spending the night before the Grand Départ the next morning. Our\n        first test was the cycle to Paddington station with our bikes loaded up\n        with all of our things for the next 16 days. Of course, it was pouring\n        down with rain for the first cycle of the trip, thankfully not a sign of\n        things to come. First hurdle for me… actually getting on my bike. The\n        weight and width of the loaded panniers made things a little unstable,\n        and my bike nearly ended up flat on the floor while I was trying to get\n        on it. Second attempt and I was safely on.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        It’s a fairly straight-forward cycle to Paddington for us, though this\n        was both of our first cycles with fully-laden bikes. We’re both quite\n        used to cycling with the London traffic, Jonathan more so and much more\n        confident with it than I am. A few km in and I was thinking that this\n        actually wasn’t all that bad (my cycles often turn out like this…), and\n        the nerves slowly started to turn into excitement for the days ahead.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        One wrong turn and just under an hour later, we were safely at\n        Paddington, with plenty of time to stock up on snacks (the carb-loading\n        starts here!) before the 5 hour journey to Penzance.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        <PostImageSingle\n          caption=\"We survived the very first cycle!\"\n          image=\"https://lauren-anders-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/48427dad-dc2c-49e9-8c9e-b4a0de45785a_1\"\n          portrait\n        />\n      </p>\n\n      <p align=\"center\">\n        <iframe height='405' width='590' frameborder='0' allowtransparency='true' scrolling='no' src='https://www.strava.com/activities/5762488219/embed/0ec6665716b28ffc51eb8329087a3495b62993c8' target=\"_blank\"></iframe>\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>End of the line</h3>\n      <p>\n        Boarding started late and the train was fully booked, so it felt a\n        little hectic trying to unload our bikes and get them racked in time.\n        Our seats were at the other end of the train to our allocated bike spots\n        so I held down the fort on the platform minding our bags while Jonathan\n        ran back and forth with both of the bikes.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        <PostImageSingle\n          caption=\"Almost time to go...\"\n          image=\"https://lauren-anders-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/48427dad-dc2c-49e9-8c9e-b4a0de45785a_2\"\n          portrait\n        />\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Just over three hours later, we were crossing the River Tamar into\n        Cornwall, over Brunel's famous Royal Albert Bridge.

Now very close to the point of no\n        return and faced with having to cycle on unfamiliar roads, my nerves had\n        well and truly returned, but seeing people about to finish their\n        End-to-End journey and having a great time doing so gave me a little bit\n        of confidence. My sorbet from Willy Wallers was also a very welcome\n        distraction!\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        <PostImageSingle\n          caption=\"Sorbet and palm trees\"\n          image=\"https://lauren-anders-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/48427dad-dc2c-49e9-8c9e-b4a0de45785a_8\"\n          portrait\n        />\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>Penzance to Lands End</h3>\n      <p>\n        The Cicerone recommended route between Penzance and Lands End is the\n        A30, which we would be taking the next day on our return to Penzance,\n        but I’d planned an alternative, more scenic coastal route to take us to\n        our campsite while we had the time. All going well, I was hoping we\n        could cycle down to a beach and spend a couple of hours there.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        However, I’d made one catastrophic mistake… I hadn’t checked the\n        elevation profile. As soon as we’d left Penzance, it was straight into a\n        14% incline. No easing ourselves into it or getting used to the added\n        weight on our bikes. It was a bit of a shock to the system, and I ended\n        up walking most of this first incline, which sparked a few laughs from a\n        passing postman - they must see this all of the time!\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        The downhills weren’t much better. I wasn’t yet used to the speed the\n        added weight gives you on a decline and I found myself hanging on for\n        dear life. We were also on a 60mph country lane, a far cry from the\n        gridlock London traffic I’m used to, so we had no choice but to\n        persevere with the hills. At least the scenery was good - green Cornish\n        countryside either side of us and the sea fast-approaching in the\n        distance.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        <PostImageSingle\n          caption=\"Getting closer...\"\n          image=\"https://lauren-anders-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/48427dad-dc2c-49e9-8c9e-b4a0de45785a_9\"\n        />\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        We gave up on the beach trip pretty easily. We were already pretty high\n        above sea level and there was no way we were subjecting ourselves to\n        more hills than we needed to! We’d taken more time to get to Lands End\n        than we thought we would, but we turned one last corner and our campsite\n        was finally in sight.\n      </p>\n\n      <p align=\"center\">\n        <iframe height='405' width='590' frameborder='0' allowtransparency='true' scrolling='no' src='https://www.strava.com/activities/5764509370/embed/e5f61d2e9c894054acf49f10d8e1cae7f1f75439' target=\"_blank\"></iframe>\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>Lands End</h3>\n      <p>\n        We were staying at the recently-opened <a href=\"https://www.landsendcamp.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Lands End Camping & Glamping</a>,\n        less than a mile away from the famous Lands End landmark. We very\n        clearly looked like we were about to start LEJOG as the owners were\n        laughing at our decision to bring an electric hook-up, and bet that we\n        would end up ditching it within a few days. They even offered to buy it\n        from us for £15, but we were determined to get some use out of it.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Tent pitched up, electric hook-up untangled and having worked up some\n        appetite on the surprise hills on our cycle to Lands End, we walked the\n        short distance into Sennen to grab some food. We walked past the\n        first/last inn in England - can't wait to see the first/last inn in\n        Scotland at the other end!\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        <PostImageSingle\n          caption=\"Our new home\"\n          image=\"https://lauren-anders-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/48427dad-dc2c-49e9-8c9e-b4a0de45785a_10\"\n          portrait\n        />\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        <PostImageSingle\n          caption=\"First & Last Inn in England\"\n          image=\"https://lauren-anders-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/48427dad-dc2c-49e9-8c9e-b4a0de45785a_11\"\n        />\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        There weren’t too many options for food in Sennen, so, being by the\n        seaside, it had to be a chippy. I think everyone else in Lands End had\n        the same idea, as we had quite a long wait outside for our food. The\n        perfect opportunity to pick up some local Tribute ale.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        <PostImageSingle\n          caption=\"Tribute and chips\"\n          image=\"https://lauren-anders-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/48427dad-dc2c-49e9-8c9e-b4a0de45785a_12\"\n          portrait\n        />\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        We walked down to the Lands End landmark to check things out. I'd only\n        read bad things about Lands End, that it’s purely a tourist trap (true)\n        and that there isn't much to see or do (also true). We’d really lucked\n        out with the beautiful sunset, which only added to the stunning views\n        from the most south-westernly tip of mainland England.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        <PostImageSingle\n          image=\"https://lauren-anders-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/48427dad-dc2c-49e9-8c9e-b4a0de45785a_13\"\n          portrait\n        />\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        <PostImageSingle\n          image=\"https://lauren-anders-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/48427dad-dc2c-49e9-8c9e-b4a0de45785a_14\"\n        />\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        <PostImageSingle\n          image=\"https://lauren-anders-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/48427dad-dc2c-49e9-8c9e-b4a0de45785a_15\"\n        />\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        <PostImageSingle\n          image=\"https://lauren-anders-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/48427dad-dc2c-49e9-8c9e-b4a0de45785a_16\"\n        />\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        <PostImageSingle\n          image=\"https://lauren-anders-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/48427dad-dc2c-49e9-8c9e-b4a0de45785a_17\"\n        />\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        <PostImageSingle\n          image=\"https://lauren-anders-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/48427dad-dc2c-49e9-8c9e-b4a0de45785a_18\"\n          portrait\n        />\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        <PostImageSingle\n          caption=\"Morph!\"\n          image=\"https://lauren-anders-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/48427dad-dc2c-49e9-8c9e-b4a0de45785a_19\"\n          portrait\n        />\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        <PostImageSingle\n          image=\"https://lauren-anders-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/48427dad-dc2c-49e9-8c9e-b4a0de45785a_20\"\n        />\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        It was the perfect time for photos with the famous signpost, as most of\n        the crowds had died down and the peddlers charging £15 for a photo had\n        already left for the day.
