days to go until I up sticks and move to the\n        Netherlands for my Erasmus year\n        at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.uu.nl/en\">Universiteit Utrecht</a>.\n        I don’t think I’ve ever switched between feeling excited and thinking\n        “what have I gotten myself into” as much as I have over the last 48 hours,\n        especially since waking up yesterday and realising that I’m leaving next\n        week!\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        For the uninitiated, the Erasmus programme is an EU student exchange\n        programme, allowing exchanges of between three months and one year. I’ll\n        be spending the third year of my degree abroad, studying Earth Science (my\n        degree is actually in Geophysics, but this isn’t offered at UU), with the\n        modules I take counting towards my degree just as they would at home. You\n        are also eligible for a grant on the Erasmus programme to contribute towards\n        the costs associated with moving and living abroad, and for Brits, you\n        pay no tuition fees while you are abroad.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Why Utrecht? I’ll be honest, while I’ve always wanted to study abroad\n        since I knew it was a thing, I’d only ever really considered going to\n        the US or Canada. When it came to choosing my year abroad options in my\n        second year, I started looking into the options available to me in the\n        US and Canada, and there was absolutely no way I could afford it. With\n        no formal partnerships between my department and American/Canadian\n        departments, I would be classed as a “visiting student” and would have\n        to pay a substantial fee per course I took. Add to that the cost of\n        flights, health insurance and accommodation, and there was no way I\n        could make it work (I did the maths multiple times) and still be able to\n        enjoy myself without having to work part-time, if that was even\n        permitted on a student visa.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        There were other options, though. I’d continued studying French as an\n        extra-curricular at university, but while my everyday French was\n        probably good enough to get by, I wasn’t confident that my French\n        Geophysics vocabulary would be strong enough. I was finding the\n        degree hard enough in English, let alone a language that I wasn’t fluent\n        in! So, I resigned to not doing my third year abroad. I was disappointed,\n        but consoled myself with knowing that there’d be other opportunities to\n        study/work/live abroad in the future, perhaps when I had a little more\n        disposable income.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        One of my friends asked me if I’d considered studying at UU. I hadn’t -\n        I’d assumed that I’d have to know Dutch, which I didn’t, but that turned\n        out to not be the case! Part of the Erasmus programme, UU had a large\n        number of exchange students, and most modules would be taught in\n        English. Bonus, being part of Erasmus, I’d have no tuition fees and I’d\n        be eligible for the Erasmus grant, taking away a good portion of my\n        money worries for the year. I spoke to the person from my department\n        currently on exchange at UU and I was sold. Utrecht looked beautiful and\n        he’d had a fantastic year. The year abroad was back on!\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Apart from a little bit of paperwork to post to UU, there hasn’t been\n        too much preparation to do before going away. Being a well-established\n        and tested exchange programme, Erasmus happily takes away most of the\n        hard work. The most crucial part was putting together the Learning\n        Agreement, which is essentially the list of modules I’ll be studying in\n        Utrecht.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <PostImageSingle\n          caption=\"The moment it all became very real... posting off my paperwork to UU\"\n          image=\"https://lauren-anders-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/f5547670-a3d8-4b32-84b5-c378dec42ff9_cover\"\n        />\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        My main concern at the moment is that I don’t know a single word of\n        Dutch. Most people I’ve spoken to about my plans for next year have\n        replied with <em>“oh, so you can speak Dutch then?”</em>. Actually, no,\n        not a word. Ashamedly, I don’t even know how to say <em>“thank\n        you”</em>.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        I didn’t want to be that typical ignorant Brit abroad, so once\n        everything was confirmed with my year abroad, I bought a book\n        called <em>Speak Dutch in 3 Months</em>. I haven’t opened it. It’s in my\n        wardrobe. The thought was there, but it’s too late now, and I’m hoping\n        that my GCSE German and eight years worth of French will at least help\n        me to pick up a little bit of Dutch.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Preparing for my big move is pretty much taking over my life right now,\n        on top of finishing a summer placement\n        at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://zxlidars.com\">ZephIR Lidar</a> in\n        the Malvern Hills, planning a joint 21st birthday/leaving party and\n        finishing off summer project work for my degree. It’s not lost on me\n        that I moved from the hustle and bustle of London to the sleepy (at\n        least in comparison) town of Malvern at the start of summer, and will\n        now be trading the Malvern Hills for one of the flattest countries\n        around.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <PostImageSingle\n          caption=\"At the top of the Malvern Hills, my home for the last couple of months\"\n          image=\"https://lauren-anders-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/f5547670-a3d8-4b32-84b5-c378dec42ff9_1\"\n          portrait\n        />\n      </p>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default PostContent;\n","import * as React from \"react\"\nimport PostContent from \"../../components/blog/posts/f5547670-a3d8-4b32-84b5-c378dec42ff9\"\nimport PageTemplate from \"../../components/templates/Page\"\nimport PostTemplate from \"../../components/templates/Post\"\n\nconst Post = () => {\n  return (\n    <PageTemplate page={\n      <PostTemplate\n        content={<PostContent />}\n        postId=\"f5547670-a3d8-4b32-84b5-c378dec42ff9\"\n      />\n    }\n    />\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Post;\n"],"names":["props","class","portrait","src","image","caption","formatDate","date","toLocaleDateString","day","month","year","postData","getBlogPost","postId","nextPostData","undefined","nextPostId","previousPostData","previousPostId","hasNextPost","hasPreviousPost","className","title","getTime","datePublished","readingTime","content","to","id","blogPosts","filter","post","Date","photo","tags","location","target","href","PostImageSingle","Page","page"],"sourceRoot":""}
