  The year abroad has begun! I arrived in Utrecht two days ago without any\n        major problems.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        I flew from Manchester to Amsterdam with KLM. On checking in, I was\n        offered to check in my hand luggage for free, which I opted for, but my\n        case arrived in Amsterdam with a broken handle. Not only that, but my\n        other suitcase was going around the carousel slightly open with a shirt\n        sleeve hanging out! Luckily, I think everything stayed in. A pretty\n        quick and non-eventful flight; this was the first time I’d ever flown\n        alone and I was feeling <em>very</em> adult.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Amsterdam Schiphol airport is <em>huge</em>. I was very thankful that\n        ESN (Erasmus Student Network) had organised a welcome meet at the\n        airport to help us buy train tickets and usher us onto the 20 minute\n        train to Utrecht. The intercity trains here are double-deckered and very\n        clean with free Wifi (I’m used to Northern Rail’s converted bus Pacer\n        trains and London Underground).\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        On arrival in Utrecht, we were shepherded onto buses to De Uithof campus\n        (where my lectures will be) by ESN to pick up our accommodation keys.\n        The bus was not only a slinky bus, but a double-slinky bus (three\n        compartments!), which blew my used-to-London-red-bus mind. Keys in hand,\n        it was a long wait for the free minibus to Van Lieflandlaan, my home for\n        the next ten months. I’d bumped into my neighbour by chance at Schiphol,\n        so at least I wasn’t totally alone while waiting.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        As an international student, I had a choice of a few student halls\n        offered by SSH Student Housing. I'd chosen Tuindorp-West Complex as it is\n        off-campus - my first year halls were off-campus, and I\n        quite liked not always being in the uni bubble. It is a bit of a commute\n        to campus on public transport, but once I have a bike, it will be a\n        15-20 minute cycle to campus and a 10 minute cycle to the city centre.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        In our flat, we have one English (me), one Welsh, four Spanish, one\n        Austrian, two Romanian and one Australian, so quite a mix. My room is\n        quite big (at least double the size of my room in my first year halls in\n        London), with a very bright orange wall - a fitting welcome to Oranje!\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        <PostImageSingle\n          image=\"https://lauren-anders-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/ea65a12f-c8af-45b4-9ba3-63210436f397_1\"\n        />\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        <PostImageSingle\n          caption=\"Appreciating the sunsets from my room\"\n          image=\"https://lauren-anders-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/ea65a12f-c8af-45b4-9ba3-63210436f397_2\"\n        />\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        No time to rest after arriving, as it was straight into university\n        induction the next day. After the faculty introduction on the first day,\n        the EGEA (European Geography Association) branch in Utrecht had\n        organised a fun afternoon of activities to welcome us. My team won the\n        quiz and our prize was a pack of stroopwafels - my first taste of a\n        stroopwafel and it did not disappoint! This was followed by a treasure\n        hunt in Utrecht, dinner at an Italian restaurant along the Oudegracht\n        canal and a pub crawl. The next day was a general exchange student\n        induction, with a lecture about Dutch culture (summary: get a bike ASAP),\n        and even more stroopwafels.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        <PostImageSingle\n          caption=\"My treasure hunt team outside the Utrecht City Hall\"\n          image=\"https://lauren-anders-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/ea65a12f-c8af-45b4-9ba3-63210436f397_3\"\n        />\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        My lectures start tomorrow, 11am - 5pm, so a pretty long day. I have\n        every Tuesday and Thursday off, and I’m only in lectures for two hours\n        on Mondays and Fridays, taking only two modules at a time. It'll be a nice\n        change from three or six hours of lectures five days a week at Imperial!\n        There seems to be a lot of emphasis on self-study here, which will be\n        something to get used to.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Some random observations:\n\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            I’m on the tenth floor of a high-rise building and my window opens\n            completely. This would never stand in the UK - my second-floor room in\n            my first-year halls opened 1cm at most!\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            Public transport runs on time.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            The apples here are <em>huge</em>.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            Squash does not seem to exist. I bought “Strawberry Dilutable Fruit\n            Drink”, expecting squash... it was syrup. Would not recommend.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <em>Everyone</em> cycles. It is probably safer to cycle than to walk\n            (no joke). I haven’t seen a single person wear a helmet. I’ve also\n            seen someone cycle while holding a keyboard and someone cycle in\n            high heels.\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        My plans for the next few days include my first lectures, activating my\n        bank account, finding an IKEA (my room desperately needs sprucing up!)\n        and a trip to the dunes this weekend with EGEA. No idea where these\n        dunes are, but welcome parties have been promised. I’m also going to\n        open my <em>Learn Dutch in 3 Months</em> book, as I feel ignorant not\n        knowing a single word.\n      </p>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default PostContent;\n","import * as React from \"react\"\nimport PostContent from \"../../components/blog/posts/ea65a12f-c8af-45b4-9ba3-63210436f397\"\nimport PageTemplate from \"../../components/templates/Page\"\nimport PostTemplate from \"../../components/templates/Post\"\n\nconst Post = () => {\n  return (\n    <PageTemplate page={\n      <PostTemplate\n        content={<PostContent />}\n        postId=\"ea65a12f-c8af-45b4-9ba3-63210436f397\"\n      />\n    }\n    />\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Post;\n"],"names":["props","class","portrait","src","image","caption","formatDate","date","toLocaleDateString","day","month","year","postData","getBlogPost","postId","nextPostData","undefined","nextPostId","previousPostData","previousPostId","hasNextPost","hasPreviousPost","className","title","getTime","datePublished","readingTime","content","to","id","blogPosts","filter","post","Date","photo","tags","location","PostImageSingle","Page","page"],"sourceRoot":""}
