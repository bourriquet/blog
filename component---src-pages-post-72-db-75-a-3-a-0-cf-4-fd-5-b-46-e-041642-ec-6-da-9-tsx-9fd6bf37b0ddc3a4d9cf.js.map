I’m very much a fair-weather cyclist\n        and I've only ever camped at music festivals, but here I am, about to\n        set off on a cycle trip from Land’s End to John o’Groats, camping along\n        the way.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Cycling either LEJOG (Land’s End to John o’Groats) or JOGLE (John\n        o’Groats to Land’s End) has never been anywhere close to my bucket list.\n        My partner, Jonathan, and I had ruled out travelling abroad this summer\n        thanks to the uncertainty around Covid-19, so we looked for things we\n        could do in the UK. The idea of a LEJOG or JOGLE cycle came to mind and\n        the more I researched it, the more I wanted to give it a go myself. If\n        not now, then when?\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Preparing for this trip has basically taken over my life. We had a lot\n        of equipment to buy, both cycling and camping, as well as campsites to\n        find, and, most importantly, a 1,000 mile route to plan. Reading others'\n        LEJOG/JOGLE blogs has been invaluable to me, so I’m hoping that this\n        post about some of the things we've had to prepare will be of use to\n        those planning a similar trip, and maybe of interest to others.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>Going it alone</h3>\n      <p>\n        This was one of the first decisions we made, and it was quite an easy\n        one for us. There is no shortage of companies offering LEJOG/JOGLE\n        packages - both \"supported\" (you cycle as a group, stay in B&Bs\n        together, have a support van that carries your things between stops) and\n        \"independent\" (the company books your accommodation for you and plans\n        your route, but you cycle by yourself).\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        This is going to be our summer holiday, so we wanted to take our time,\n        stop whenever we wanted to and see some sights. Cycling as part of an\n        organised group would have perhaps taken some of that freedom away from\n        us. There was also something about planning the entire thing ourselves\n        and carrying everything with us that added to the fun!\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>The route</h3>\n      <p>\n        I wasn't too keen on cycling on A-roads the whole way, so the fastest\n        route was immediately off the table. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.sustrans.org.uk/national-cycle-network/lands-end-to-john-ogroats-lejog\">Sustrans route</a> was\n        a good candidate as it is entirely traffic-free paths and quiet roads\n        - perfect for me! However, I'm planning on taking my road bike, which\n        won't cope well on some of the off-road paths, and I wasn't up\n        for buying a new bike just for this trip.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cicerone.co.uk/why-cicerone-lejog-cycling-route-optimal-choice\">Cicerone route</a> claims\n        to be the \"optimal\" route - quiet roads where possible, busier roads\n        where necessary. The route has been tried and tested on multiple bike\n        types and adapted over the last twelve years. The recommended time for\n        this route is two weeks, which was perfect for us given our other summer\n        plans and needing to get back to work. The only downside to this route\n        (for us, or maybe just me) is that the quieter traffic-free roads tend\n        to come at a cost... hills.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        My local library had a copy of the accompanying book available, which\n        came with GPX files to download. These came in really handy for planning\n        the more specific parts of our route such as where we were going to stop\n        at night.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        <PostImageSingle\n          caption=\"Our bible for the summer\"\n          image=\"https://lauren-anders-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/72db75a3-a0cf-4fd5-b46e-041642ec6da9_cover\"\n        />\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        We plan to follow the Cicerone route as closely as we can, though will\n        be adapting some of the recommended overnight stops along the way as we\n        want to spend more time in Cornwall and Scotland. Due to where our\n        families live, it is quite straight-forward for us to visit the North\n        West, the Midlands and the Bristol area, so we are happy to power\n        through these parts of the route to spend more time in the parts of the\n        country which we visit less frequently. We also have no rest days\n        planned, aiming for ~80 miles/day.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>LEJOG or JOGLE?</h3>\n      <p>\n        LEJOG is generally the preferred route among end-to-enders. As you’re\n        cycling in a mostly northerly direction, the sun is behind you and out\n        of your eyes, and the rumour is that the prevailing south-westerly wind\n        helps you along the way. The cycling is also toughest in\n        Cornwall, with steep inclines and declines... something I\n        wanted to tackle at the start of the trip before the exhaustion had set\n        in! Though there is the argument that by doing JOGLE, the Cornish hills\n        should be easier as your cycling fitness will have improved having\n        already climbed plenty of hills before reaching Cornwall.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Ultimately, our decision came down to the transport options available to us.\n        Living in London, it was pretty much a no-brainer for us to take the\n        train to the end-points, rather than fly or rent cars. The train can get\n        you 15 miles from Land's End and ~20 miles from John o'Groats, so not\n        too far to cycle at either end. Flying would have meant sorting out bike\n        boxes at either end, plus transportation to/from Exeter and Inverness airports.\n        Driving would have just been a horrible nightmare, not even worth considering.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        It is free to take a bike onto a train in the UK, though reservations\n        are usually compulsory. These can get snapped up pretty quickly for\n        long-distance journeys, especially the Caledonian Sleeper, which we were\n        keen on taking, as the daytime London-Inverness journey includes\n        changes. There were two bike spots available on a Tuesday night from\n        Inverness to London in August - LEJOG it was!\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>Sleeping</h3>\n      <p>\n        Of course, we weren't the only ones booking accommodation in the UK\n        given the year of the staycation. Cycle-friendly hotel/B&B availability\n        was looking sparse, and more expensive than we were prepared to pay for\n        this trip. We figured camping would give us more flexibility, save us\n        some money and also add to the adventure. The real adventure would\n        have been to wild camp the entire way, but we wanted to keep the camping\n        equipment we needed to carry to a minimum. I also didn't want to be\n        washing in lakes for two weeks!\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Finding campsites with availability in August was difficult, and many\n        had 2-night minimum bookings (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.campsites.co.uk/search\">campsites.co.uk</a> is\n        a really helpful website for finding campsites). After a lot of\n        enquiring and shuffling around of our planned stops, we eventually found\n        campsites relatively close to the Cicerone route with availability for\n        most nights of the trip. The exception was the Bristol area, for which we have\n        had to book an Airbnb as we haven't been able to find a campsite with\n        availability. This feels like cheating a little bit, but I don't think\n        we'll be complaining once we're there.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        <PostImageSingle\n          caption=\"Our planned stops in green (Google Maps)\"\n          image=\"https://lauren-anders-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/72db75a3-a0cf-4fd5-b46e-041642ec6da9_1\"\n          portrait\n        />\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>The wheels</h3>\n      <p>\n        Hybrid/touring bikes are recommended for unsupported long-distance\n        cycles, but I had already resigned to taking my road bike for this trip.\n        I was lucky enough to get a ballot spot for the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ridelondon.co.uk/\">RideLondon 100</a> last\n        year, and bought a road bike especially for it (my other bike is a\n        Dutch-style city bike, which I love for short local cycles but it's not\n        suitable for RideLondon 100 or LEJOG). RideLondon 100 was unfortunately\n        cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and while I've cycled my road\n        bike around London and up Box Hill, it would be nice to get some more\n        mileage out of it.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        My road bike isn't a particularly flashy model and was relatively cheap,\n        but it's light enough and I feel comfortable riding it, though I'm\n        anticipating a bit of a bumpy ride if we do need to go off-road!\n        One downside is that my frame doesn't have many eyelets for attaching\n        accessories, but there are workarounds.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        <PostImageSingle\n          caption=\"My bike on unboxing day last year\"\n          image=\"https://lauren-anders-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/72db75a3-a0cf-4fd5-b46e-041642ec6da9_3\"\n        />\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        I sent my bike off for a full service with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.havebike.co.uk/\">HaveBike</a> a\n        couple of weeks ago. I was fairly confident my bike wouldn't need any major\n        repairs, so I did leave it a little bit later than I probably should\n        have for a pre-trip service. Luckily I was right, and I only needed a\n        pedal disc replacement. Jonathan had less luck with his bike. He also\n        used HaveBike to service his (hybrid) bike, but, unlike me, did give it\n        plenty of time as his bike has had a lot more use than mine.\n        Unfortunately, he needed a pretty major repair, and HaveBike were having\n        supply chain issues with sourcing the needed part in time. Even if the\n        bike was returned without the repair, he wouldn't have been able to\n        cycle it, so he had to buy a new bike (another hybrid) with quite short\n        notice.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>Bike equipment</h3>\n      <p>\n        This would be our first touring trip, so we had a fair bit of equipment\n        to buy. By far the most important things were panniers and rear racks.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        For panniers, I went for the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/540-waterproof-double-pannier-rack-bike-bags-2-x-20l/_/R-p-193373?mc=8403056&c=BLACK\">ELOPS 2x20L double pannier</a>.\n        I preferred the double panniers as they will be easier to get on and\n        off trains and carry around if we do stop anywhere. They're rainproof\n        but not immersion-proof, but I figured if they are being immersed, then\n        something has gone drastically wrong! All of the contents will be in dry\n        bags anyway, so having completely waterproof panniers isn't a priority\n        for me. Jonathan went for two <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/mp/altura/thunderstorm-adventure-pannier-adventure-red-25l-waterproof-hi-viz/_/R-p-822c3523-1afc-4b39-8a76-39987c718501?mc=822c3523-1afc-4b39-8a76-39987c718501_c14\">fancier 25L panniers</a>,\n        likely to be much more waterproof with the roll-tops.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        We looked into frame bags, but took our time buying them as there were\n        a lot of options and we weren't too sure how many we needed. Jonathan's\n        friend lent us a couple of waterproof frame bags in the end; a big one\n        which we will be using as a tool bag and a smaller one which we'll be\n        using as an essentials grab bag (money, phones, face mask) for when we\n        go into shops for example. I’ll also be taking a high-vis mini rucksack\n        for easy-grab snacks (very important).\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        For rear racks, we both went for the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.halfords.com/cycling/bike-accessories/bike-pannier-racks/tortec-transalp-rear-disc-rack-26-700c---black-583858.html?cm_mmc=Google+PLA-_-Cycling%3EBike+Accessories%3EPannier+Racks-_-Cycling%3EBike+Accessories%3EPannier+Racks-_-583858&istCompanyId=b8708c57-7a02-4cf6-b2c0-dc36b54a327e&istFeedId=62b447cf-331e-4fec-a47a-9985ff72d404&istItemId=xqqxrxwq&istBid=tzwp&_$ja=tsid:|cid:17326032867|agid:|tid:|crid:|nw:x|rnd:5851281770910016610|dvc:c|adp:|mt:|loc:9045909&gclid=CjwKCAjwtIaVBhBkEiwAsr7-c9cJ7_xd4I58Ra2ksuSMZ9wKhylKGOaSs9wKocJ7zJnDuE0pPhxD4xoCjqMQAvD_BwE\">Tortec Transalp rear disc rack</a>.\n        Jonathan attached his to his bike fairly easily as he has eyelets, but\n        mine took a bit longer. One workaround we'd found to attach a rear rack\n        to a bike without eyelets is to use <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/mp/tortec/p-clips/_/R-p-c2fa9fd8-3d6b-4581-b01b-793af30e140e?mc=c2fa9fd8-3d6b-4581-b01b-793af30e140e_c1&utm_term=429db383-d321-47b5-b806-c7b91d332ebc&gclid=CjwKCAjwtIaVBhBkEiwAsr7-cwSTu2PntaoQU1Ehl5Gj5Kw4bHvvEFjCxVAPd0o0PI1qUQXv2__4dRoCr0wQAvD_BwE&iv_=__iv_p_1_g_135919246024_c_557229211113_w_aud-1032351663542%253Apla-329717981662_n_g_d_c_v__l__t__r_x_pla_y_15177021_f_online_o_429db383-d321-47b5-b806-c7b91d332ebc_z_GB_i_en_j_329717981662_s__e__h_9045909_ii__vi__&gclsrc=aw.ds\">P-clips</a> (essentially\n        mini clamps). Four P-clips later and my rear rack was attached to my\n        bike, and it felt much more secure than I was expecting. I've done a\n        couple of test rides with weights in my panniers and the P-clips haven't\n        slipped at all. We'll be taking some spares with us though as I doubt\n        that will be the case over 1,000 miles.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        We had less luck attaching mudguards to my bike. While I did have\n        eyelets near my wheels, there just wasn’t enough clearance between the\n        tyre and the frame to attach the guards. I was so desperate to get them\n        to fit, that we even tried sawing down the attachment, but there was no\n        way. I’m just going to have to cope with a muddy back!\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        <PostImageSingle\n          caption=\"Our house became a bike workshop for a couple of weeks\"\n          image=\"https://lauren-anders-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/72db75a3-a0cf-4fd5-b46e-041642ec6da9_4\"\n          portrait\n        />\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        We've decided to forego a GPS bike computer... we will\n        probably regret this decision. We're both taking our phones (and\n        battery packs), so we should be okay for navigation if we get lost.\n        We've also got print-outs of our intended route, handily split up by\n        day, as a back-up.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Clothing-wise, I desperately needed some padded cycling shorts. My bike\n        seat isn't the most comfortable, and I will be on my bike <i>a lot</i> over\n        the next two weeks, so I definitely need some support. I also picked up\n        a new high-vis jacket as my current one isn't very breathable. The new\n        one is only splashproof but it's at least very light for cycling. I hate\n        cycling in sunglasses, but over 1,000 miles, I knew that I would end\n        up needing to use them at some point. I found a pair and even though I\n        haven't worn them yet, I've somehow managed to scratch the lens! We’ve\n        both decided not to bother with cleats or waterproof shoes, another\n        decision we’ll probably regret.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Another essential for me is cycling gloves. My hands are quite small and\n        they cramp up on my handles over long distances, especially in the rain.\n        Gloves take off a little bit of that pressure while trying to maintain\n        my grip. I already had some (very cheap) cycling gloves in a very\n        beautiful fluorescent orange, but I will be taking some weight training\n        gloves as a back up.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        The absolute minimum essentials - decent helmets and lights - we both of\n        course already had, and we also picked up a few bungee cords from\n        the bargain bin at Go Outdoors, as well as a handful of inner tubes.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>Camping equipment</h3>\n      <p>\n        I've always written off camping as being <em>not for me</em>. I'm a\n        fairly light sleeper and I find the whole experience cramped and very\n        uncomfortable. Saying that, I've only ever camped in cheap and\n        definitely not waterproof festival tents. I've been promised many a\n        time that <em>actual</em> camping is much more enjoyable, so I'm going\n        into this with an open mind.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Buying a legitimate, actually waterproof yet portable tent was something\n        we didn't take lightly. A good hour was spent testing out the many options\n        in Go Outdoors, eventually deciding on a 3-person Coleman tent with a\n        little porch area, good waterproof rating and 10-minute assembly time.\n        Certainly an improvement on my previous £8 1-man tents! We took the tent\n        to <a href=\"https://www.valleyfest.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Valleyfest</a> to\n        test it out for the night. My first night in a proper tent and I actually\n        had a good night’s sleep! Perhaps camping is for me after all.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        <PostImageSingle\n          caption=\"Testing out the tent at Valleyfest (the outer is a bit off-centre!)\"\n          image=\"https://lauren-anders-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/72db75a3-a0cf-4fd5-b46e-041642ec6da9_7\"\n          portrait\n        />\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        The next challenge was trying to figure out what we could take with us\n        while keeping weight and volume to a minimum. We both went for light\n        Berghaus summer sleeping bags, Jonathan a self-inflating sleeping mat,\n        and me a blow-up sleeping mat with attached pillow. No cooking equipment\n        - we just didn’t have the room, and I feel like we’ll be wanting more\n        substantial meals after burning 4,000+ calories a day.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        As we’ll be relying on our phones a lot throughout the trip for\n        navigating, taking photos and recording on Strava, we needed an electric\n        hook-up. It’ll add on significant weight/bulk to our bikes, but we\n        figured it’d be worth it for guaranteed electricity. I don’t think we’ll\n        have enough time to sit in pubs or cafes waiting for phones to charge.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>Training</h3>\n      <p>\n        I had grand hopes of putting in some serious mileage in training for\n        this trip… cycling the London Loop, cycling to Brighton, maybe even a\n        weekend cycling around the Isle of Wight, throwing in some much-needed\n        hill training along the way. None of this happened, nor has any real\n        long-distance training at that. Luckily, I do work out a lot as it is,\n        so I’ve made myself feel better by convincing myself that it’s all\n        cross-training. Even so, the closer the trip has become, the more I’ve\n        panicked about my lack of training, especially when it comes to hills.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        I knew I needed to get some practice with handling the weight and width\n        the panniers will add to my bike. So I set off on a cycle a few days ago\n        with some dumbbells in my panniers to add some weight. And it was\n        raining! Another box ticked.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        <PostImageSingle\n          caption=\"Braving the elements for a training cycle\"\n          image=\"https://lauren-anders-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/72db75a3-a0cf-4fd5-b46e-041642ec6da9_5\"\n          portrait\n        />\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        While I was cycling down a contraflow cycle\n        lane, I noticed a smashed glass bottle, but it was too late to do\n        anything about it without swerving into oncoming traffic, so I had to\n        cycle through it. I thought I’d managed to get away with it, but about\n        half an hour later, my back tyre was completely flat. 7 miles from home,\n        no spare inner tubes and too late for any bike workshops to still be\n        open. I had no choice but to start walking home with the bike (terrible\n        for the wheel of course), until Jonathan was back from swimming and\n        could pick me and my out-of-action bike up.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Taking a closer look at home, the damage was <em>bad</em>. A piece of\n        glass had left a large hole in the sidewall of my tyre. I looked into my\n        repair options, but with sidewall punctures, it is best to just\n        completely replace the tyre. You can “boot patch” a hole in a tyre, but\n        these only last for about 200km, and we have over 1,600km to cycle! Even\n        if I replaced the boot patch every 200km, the risk of tyre blowouts is\n        still quite high, and not worth the risk. I’m gutted because I love the\n        yellow-rim road tyres on my bike and they’re now discontinued, but I\n        know I do need something more practical and less puncture-prone for this\n        trip.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        <PostImageSingle\n          caption=\"The culprit\"\n          image=\"https://lauren-anders-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/72db75a3-a0cf-4fd5-b46e-041642ec6da9_6\"\n        />\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Luckily, I managed to get a new tyre delivered yesterday (bit of a panic\n        as I wasn’t due to be at home), and I got out on a longer drama-free\n        test cycle earlier today.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>Sightseeing</h3>\n      <p>\n        It's a holiday! We want to see things. A few weeks ago, I was pinged by\n        the NHS app to self-isolate for a week as I had been in contact with\n        someone who had tested positive for Covid-19. I luckily didn't contract\n        Covid-19 myself, but I used the time to pore through the numerous travel\n        books I'd already checked out from the library and put together a list of\n        things we could see along the way. Easier said than done, as we will be\n        lumbered with two bikes and all of our things, but we might be able to\n        tick some of them off.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        <PostImageSingle\n          caption=\"Points of interest along the way (Google Maps).
